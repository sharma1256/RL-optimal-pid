[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/controlgym.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/controlgym/)

## Description 
This repository provides the framework used to conduct the experiments for our paper "Globally Optimal Policy Gradient Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning with PID Control Policies", appearing in 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025). The paper can be found here
