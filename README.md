# Policy Gradient Reinforcement Learning with PID Control Policies
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/controlgym.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/controlgym/)

## Description 
This repository provides the framework used to conduct the experiments for our paper "Globally Optimal Policy Gradient Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning with PID Control Policies", appearing in 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025). The paper link will be soon available here.

The model-based  `PG4PID` and model-free `PG4PI` policy gradient algorithm for tuning Optimal Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller on the LA University Hospital `lah` and the Chemical Reactor `rea` environemnt from `controlgym` suite of environments.
